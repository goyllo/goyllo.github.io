Google sandbox refers to waiting time period when a new website gets stuck to the second and third page of Google even the keywords competition is very low.

It's happened with all webmaster, it does not mean whether your site is good or bad, or you’re following good/bad SEO practice, the Google sandbox effect, apply to all new websites.

## Why Google sandbox new websites? ##
Google does not rank your new website instantly within a one month because they don’t know whether your content is trusted or not. If they rank new sites in short time, then lot’s of spammer try to trick Google ranking and get lots of organic traffic, which may not satisfy the user query. So Google will wait for more than one month and see how the content will change and what you’re doing with your new site.

## What will happen if Google sandbox your new website? ##
You will be stuck into Google second, and the third search result page, even the competition of keyword is very low. I have seen, Google display another website result even their content does not match correctly as like our site content.

## How your site can be stuck into the Google sandbox? ##
1. If they see your content is thin/copied/low quality, then your site will be stuck into sandbox forever.

2. If they see your site suddenly get many of spam links, then your site will be stuck into sandbox unless you don’t block those spam links via disavow tool. So always analysis “Links to your site” from Google search console And don’t participate in any blackhat technique.

## Now, how to get out from Google sandbox? ##
Most of all new webmaster can get out of sandbox very easily because they follow natural ways. They don’t participate in any blackhat technique, so here I do the same steps.

**1. Create minimum four pages in your website.**

One Homepage, one blog post, one contact us page and one about us page. Make sure these four pages contain at least 500 words(Except contact us page). Well, this is a not apply for all kind of website, but if you have a niche site, then it’s good practice. One page application like Minify CSS tool can even rank, but it’s another case. So generally if your site contains some text, then I think making four pages is good practice.

**2. Create social media profiles**

Create your social media presence by making your profile/pages on the top social media website, for example, Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Linkedin, <a href="https://ello.co/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ello</a> (Oops, it gives us dofollow backlinks :p), Reddit, Instagram, etc. So just create your account and add your website link in your profile.

**3. Link your social media profiles from your website.**

Linking your social media profiles from your site gives a boost in trust rank. If they crawl and index your social media profiles, then I am sure you’ll earn some trust rank. If they don’t index your social media profiles then there is no any profit to create social media profiles, so make sure your social media profiles are index. By linking your profile URL’s from your website may index your profile naturally. Otherwise, you can also use Google Webmaster Submit URL Tool. Usually, I don’t use any ping tool.

**4. Share your content.**

Once you post something on your website, then I highly recommended sharing that article/post on your social media profiles as well. <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JohnMueller/posts/J2uoX6dj4LR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">This post from John Mueller might open your eyes (see second point).</a>

**5. Rinse and repeat.**

Now start posting another blog post and keep sharing that article on your social media pages/profiles. 

## My niche website details. ##

**1. I mostly post two articles in one week.** 

Sometimes I post one per week. While other Pro SEO webmaster will say post your content regularly, you have to post one article per day, but that’s myth, there is no any co-relation between how frequently you should post your article vs. ranking. The more articles you’ll post regularly the more Google will crawl your web page, and the more Pagerank you will get. I will talk more about PageRank in my future blog post and want to say one thing **<a href="https://twitter.com/methode/status/829755916895535104" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">It is still a heart of Google algorithm.</a>**

**2. My most articles are not more than 800 Words.** 

So if you still believe that, 2000 words article will rank higher than 800 words article, then you’re wrong. One Good example is, check StackOverflow/StackExchange website, they are getting lot’s of organic traffic with just 600 words(Main Content, not sidebar or footer). Actually by writing 2000 words per article sometimes hurt your ranking, when people don’t read your whole post and get back to see another search result. Google also use one ranking factor which determines the quality of web page, by checking how many times user read a particular web page. For example, if the page is about a video, and the user sees that page for a longer time then Google assume, yes visitor is satisfied with that search result, same apply for an article. So if your article is 2000 words and most of the people switch back to another result, in just 5 minutes, then Google assumes the user is not satisfied; now again I want to say Google don’t use your analytic reports, but there are lots of others way to measure such things.

**3. I don’t build any other kind of backlinks.**

 - No Forum Links.
 - No Comment Links.
 - No High-quality links from news or education website (This is purely black hat technique, people assume it’s fine, but it is not. Paying money for links is violate their terms and condition).

The links I build is only social media profiles/pages, and I don’t call it I build links, I just did my site promotion which is totally fine for all website.

**4. I got a higher position within three months.**

Here is SS from my one of the niche website. That niche I found via reverse-engineering, one hint is via CPA offer :p Second thing is I use exact match domain for that keyword. As you can see on below screenshot,  I jump to the second position suddenly from 30th position when the Google sandbox time is over.

So, you don’t need to use any blackhat techniques, finding low competition keywords and ranking on that keywords is art. And one biggest art is to monetize those websites. I don’t use AdSense for my niche website. There are lots of other ways to monetize your sites other than AdSense and affiliate sells(CPS Offer). Most of the company just want right customers information for their business, for example, email ID’s(CPL offers), on which they pay you $7 per valid email confirmation (i.e. Double opt-in CPA offer). And believe me, the organic traffic is high quality traffic than any other media buying strategy. They even bump your payout, if you send them more quality leads. Well, we will talk all about these in a future blog post, stay tune with us.
