description: Get access to Ahrefss and majestic tool at very lower rate by using Flikover - A Premium SEO tools group buy service.
---

<a href="https://cdn.goyllo.com/po/flikover/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Flikover</a> is group buy service, which gives us access to many premium tools at very low price. You can also [check the full list of flikover products](#all-flikover-products) at the end of this blog post with INR and USD price information. But let me tell you the first few tools which I personally used.

## Ahrefs ##

**Ahrefs is best SEO Tool for backlink analysis**. There are so many niche out there on which you can't get natural backlinks, so you've to spy on your competitor blog/website to know how they build backlinks, so you can do the same. 

**Ahrefs Standard account price - 399$/Monthly<br/>
Flikover price - $10/month.**


## Majestic ##

Majestic is old backlink analysis tool and best alternative of Ahrefs. So if you can't find out your competition backlink profiles on Ahrefs (because they block it), then try out majestic, you'll surely find many backlinks. I have seen majestic crawl large amount of webpages compare to Ahrefs.

**Majestic Pro Account Price - $99/monthly<br/>
Flikover Price - $7/month**

## Grammarly ##

Grammarly is best proofreading software, and helps a lot to correct grammar. You must use it, if you're not native English speaker, like me. 

**Premium Account - $29.95/monthly<br/>
Flikover Price - $5/monthly**

## FAQ on Flikover ##

**Q. Is this tool legit to use?**

A. Many of people think it is cracked or hacked version of SEO tools, but thatâ€™s not true. Generally, they buy one account on the particular website and use a proxy server(Chrome Extension) in the middle, which handles all request + authentication automatically. So technically only one user(IP) is logged in on particular site like Ahrefs.

**Q. Is there any limit to use it?**

A. No there is no any limit, you will get all functionality like you get, from above standard plans. 

*Note - When you register your account on flikover, then use your valid mobile number, because they send auto generated password on that mobile number.*
