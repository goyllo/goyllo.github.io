3.  Now sort out your result with impressions or clicks option. **Try both to understand which query does not perform well.**

So here the keyword “find blogger sitemap” has 242 impressions, 0 clicks and position is 17.7. It means for that keyword my blog post is ranking on the second page of Google because the position is 17.7 (For 1 to 10 position, it will rank on the first page). And there is 242 impression, it means 242 times my site is displayed to users (If they use auto scrolling and Google display my site automatically then it also count as an impression). So there is no guarantee that you will get more clicks for higher impression, the impression means Google just display your site result, nothing more, and here 0 click means user have not clicked to my website. So this kind of data is useful, so you can tweak your blog post based on that information, to get more organic traffic.

You should note that the position is displayed as average position, based on the user devices, language and location, you can refer <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6155685?hl=en#choosingmetrics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google official docs on this</a>.
