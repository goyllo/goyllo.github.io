Blogger and WordPress is best blogging platform if you want to start a blog, so here we gonna compare Blogger a.k.a BlogSpot and Wordpress a.k.a Wordpress.org platforms. This is not typically a blog post which says only wordpress is superieor on all things, here I will share genuine facts about both platform, so let's start it.

## 1. Pricing. ##

We all know if you want to start a self hosting wordpress blog, then it's require addition hosting service which generally cost you $100 per year, so if you're in tight budget then blogger is fanstatisc for you. So here in terms of budget the blogger is clear winner.

## 2. Traffic ##

As I said self hosting blog require addition host, but when the traffic is increase you've to buy bigger package like VPS or dedicated server, it means more money you need to spent, it's fine for most of wordpress user, because higher traffic means more advertising profit. But if you're not adding any ads on your site and have large number of traffic, then blogger is good option, because it handle very large amount of traffic for free. 

## 3. Security. ##

Security is major problem in the internet world, wordpress is used by many people, hence attacker mostly target that, and additionally it is open source software means attacker know all wordpress codes, so they find more vulnerability easily. While blogger does not disclose any codes behind a original software hence large number of attacker can't find out more vulnerability, but it does not mean blogger is fully secure, all things are vulnerable, but here blogger is much secure compare to wordpress. Bug again it is not like that wordpress is easy to hack, if you do regular backup, using latest version of wordpress and learn some security protocols, then you're totally fine with wordpress as well.

## 4. SEO ##

This is where other blogger misguided about blogger, they think Wordpress is much SEO friendly then blogger, actually I agree with them. But the fact is the blogging platform only affect 1% in SEO. So if you think, wordpress blog post will rank higher easily in Google compare to blogger, then it's not true. The SEO is depend on ON page SEO and off page SEO, and platform does not add any things. But still I will say that wordpress is good SEO friendly because Blogger add large number of addition codes which make pagespeed score lower, but rest of things in blogger is already SEO friendly. For example Blogger generate sitemap automatically, support custom permalink option, support 301 redirection, provide custom robots.txt, support meta description, then what else you need? Other things like open meta graph tool codes you can add it manually. Blogger is actually SEO friendly by default, but I don't know why most pro blogger misguide user.

## 5. Design. ##

Design is most importing factor in blog, because that is what attract most people to your site. Blogger default themes are not good looking while wordpress provider tons of wordpress theme totally free, because it is open source software and lot's of designer contribute to it. Yes there are also blogger designer as well, but most pro one, now build theme for a wordpress user, because there is more opportunities for designer. But if you know CSS code yourself then you can make your blogger blog look exactly like any other wordpress blog, since design is implemented by css codes and blogger support to add CSS code manually, but the fact is that designer is designer, and you can't think like them, they are pretty good to make things very cool, hence  if you know CSS then still you can't make a professional theme like they do.

## 6. Plugins ##

Yeah this is what I love about Wordpress, you can find every plugins for everything. You want to add Open graph protocol, then simply do a search on plugin directory and you will find lot's of plugin from different developer. Blogger also support third party widget but for that you have to build code yourself, or need to do Google search like how to add ogp codes in blogger blog, how to add facebook likebox in blogger blog, how to embed tweets in my blogger blog post etc.

So who is real winner?

Actually it's depend on you, what kind of blog you want to build? If it is very professional and you don't want to spent some time by making things work then surely go with wordpress because on that you will find every things very easily. But if you've tight budget then surely you can go with blogger as well, it's not bad platform at all. Many pro blogger started their first blog in blogger, and later when they earn some money the they migrate it to wordpress.
