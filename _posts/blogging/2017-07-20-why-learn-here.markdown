Creating a blog is an easy task, anybody can do it. But people have a different mindset, and that is what makes them a successful blogger or failure. Most of all bloggers fall into greed. Yes, greed about making money online. They have seen some blogger who is making $XXXXX per month and want to do the same. They may have seen some earning reports or their luxury lifestyle and want to become the same, but let me tell you first, the earning reports and their lifestyle pics are not made for inspiration. And never inspire your life by seeing other people success, instead see their real efforts on it, read books, watch Ted videos, go for travel, etc.

They share earning reports, blueprints, eBook, promo videos, their life style pics, etc., so you follow their methods. Their methods include affiliate links, which means if you buy something from that links, then they will get some commission, and **this is why they teach you how to make money online**. Now, most of all blogger suggest things based on their own profits, for example, bluehost is terrible service for any blog, but still, they recommended it to people, because they get more than $100 commission per sale. If they recommended other good hosting service, then they will hardly get ​$10 or $30 commission per sale. Most of all well-known bloggers out there do the same thing and earning huge money.  They may say they personally test them, and it’s reliable service, but it’s partially true. Even they don’t use it personally on their own blog.

But here I am not going to do that, and I will share here only those things which are really good for you, I will think zero about my own profits. For example, here I will tell you, how to start your own professional blog on a cloud for free, instead of wasting $100 in hosting as a newbie. Nobody will say about that, because if they talk about it, then they will get zero dollar commission. Also, I will tell you how to get some SEO tools for a very cheap rate which typically cost you $50 or $100 per month. I will also tell you how to start email marketing which cost you nothing/very cheaper compare to Aweber, MailChimp, ConvertKit, Constant Contact, etc. Those things you will never see on other blogs because by doing that, they will get zero commission.

I just want to say one thing, wake up and start doing real stuff. If you blog about tech then spy how other tech blogs are doing, if you blog about traveling then spy how other travel blogs are doing. You really don’t need to take any advice from GURU who just talk about making money online. Check out my this post, [why some people failed into blogging?](/why-people-failed-into-blogging/)
