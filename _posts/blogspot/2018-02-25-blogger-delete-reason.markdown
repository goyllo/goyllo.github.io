Many of the beginner and spammers, always ask this question on the Google Blogger help forum, “why Blogger team deleted my blog”. They will notify you, in your email address, whenever they delete your blogger blog. And they deleted your blog because you did not follow their <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/41935?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> TOS </a>and <a href="http://www.blogger.com/content.g?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Policy</a>. So here I post some of the basic reason why they deleted your blogger blog.

In starting, your blog does not get much traffic from anywhere. So the blogger team does not have any complaints or notice about your blog. But when you start driving more traffic from search engines or social media, then many of people will see your blog. If they notice, you are not using blogger platform legally. Then they can complain your blog to Google. So the Blogger team manually check your blog. And if they find you misuse their platform, then they will delete your blog, and yes you can make an appeal, but in the rare case they will restore your blog. They also use automation techniques by scrapping and crawling your blogs. So if they find below bad things on your blog, then they will delete your blog automatically.

## 1. Your Many blogs look's like spam ##

If you made any mistake, and your blog is deleted by blogger team, then you are going to create another blog, it means blogger know that particular user will be going to misuse their platforms again, so don’t create too many Spam blog in one account. If you’re serious about blogging, then create another Gmail account and start blogging seriously.

## 2. Scam Redirection ##

Many of Pop advertising network or Third Party Javascript code, redirect users to the scam affiliate/advertising page, so that kind of redirection is harmful to the user.

## 3. Spam or Paid Links ##

Many of people mention any kind of links in their post without using the nofollow attributes. If you are not using <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" >nofollow</a> attributes on paid/ads link, then Google will crawl that page and will report your blog automatically if those pages contain malicious/paid advertising content.

## 4. Annoying Third party Ads ##

I know getting Google AdSense on another topic is tough. But don’t use third party ads, which display abuse and annoying ads. Blogger doesn't like when you monetize bad content with bad ads.

## 5. Hate speech ##

I know Many of Governments gives you the freedom to talk freely in cyberspace. But Google Blogger doesn’t allow that. So whenever you post any articles, then make sure it does not hurt any person/religion.

## 6. Copyright content ##
Many of bloggers directly use any images, videos, and files (cracked software+hacked content) in their post without checking its license first. Also, some spammer copy pastes someone articles on their post. Yes, you will not penalize immediately, but when you start driving more and more traffic to your blog, your chances of deletion will also increase. At last, I want to say. Only those, high traffic blogs have been running for a long time, which is doing blogging with genuine way.
