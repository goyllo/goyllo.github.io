You can now enable official SSL certificate with your custom domain. This future is currently in beta, but every blogger can use it via draft.blogger.com.

1. First go to <a href="https://draft.blogger.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">draft.blogger.com</a>
2. Go to setting, then basic and choose yes in HTTPS availability.<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="https://cdn.goyllo.com/blogspot/blogger-https-aviliability-in-custom-domain.png" />
3. Now go back to your main blogger dashboard(blogger.com).
4. Now wait for few minutes, and you can see same option there as well, so choose yes in both option. I enable it in just 2 minute, but it may take long time for your blog, because they register your SSL certificate automatically for your custom domain.
